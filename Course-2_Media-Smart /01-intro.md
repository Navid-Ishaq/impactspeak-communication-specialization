## 🧭 Introduction: Why You Should Understand the Media

When Sarah, a young product manager at **BrightTech Solutions**, was asked to give a few words during a press event, she froze. Not because she didn’t know her work—but because she had no idea how to speak in front of cameras or handle journalists. Meanwhile, her colleague Jack handled the same situation with ease. What made the difference? **Media awareness**. This course is designed to help people like Sarah feel calm, confident, and in control when they step into any media interaction—be it a press conference, interview, or a news story about their work.

## 📺 What *Is* the Media and Why Does It Matter?

The media is more than just news anchors or newspapers. It’s the world of messages we consume—TV reports, podcasts, blogs, social media, even interviews on YouTube.

In this course, you’ll learn how stories are selected, how headlines are crafted, and how public perception is formed—so you can better manage your own story.

You’ll explore how **traditional media** (TV, newspapers, radio) differs from **digital media** (social, blogs, YouTube), and how to speak effectively in both. This helps you adjust your message depending on where and how it will appear.
